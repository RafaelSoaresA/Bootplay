### Rafael Soares - FrontEnd

Welcome to my FrontEnd project! I will tell down bellow how to run the project!
##

### Preparation:

- Install the following extensions in your VSCode: Tabnine, Color Highlight, ES7 + React/Redux. ESLint, IntelliCode, IntelliCode Api Usage, PostCSS, Prettier, Reactjs code Snippets, tailwind CSS and Docker.
- Clone the repository, you can choose the best way for you, I personally like to use the GitHub Desktop, but there are other options.
##

### Run the project:

-When the project is open, use the following command in the terminal:
npm install
This will download the dependencies in the project
- Now you're able to run the project, use this command:
npm run dev
